This folder represent the work done on 3rd of February. It uses MATLAB to process speech captured by iPhone for offline algorithm verification. This is accomplished in process_raw_buffer.m

We can also take a wav file, recorded out of iPhone and convert it to a raw buffer. This buffer can be put into the iPhone for comparison of MATLAB and iPhone algorithms. This is accomplished wiht generate_raw_buffer.m
