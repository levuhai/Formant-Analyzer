<H4 ALIGN=Left>Normalization Procedure</H4>

<P>The normalization procedure was a simple program run on all
sound vectors before analyzing them.  The process scales and
shifts the sound vectors so they have a max amplitude of one and
have a average value of zero.  This removes DC component from the 
Frourier transform and also ensures that the amplitude of the
transforms are of similar magnitude.</P>
