<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Conclusions</H2>

<P> Wavelets prove ineffective in our process since we found we
lacked the necessary frequency resolution to determing vowel
sounds or pitch.  Perhaps sampling at higher than 8khz would give
better results, but the processing cost needed to pursue higher
sampling rates led us other methods...</P>

<P>Formants analysis is an effective way of analyzing vowel sounds
regardless of speaker.  If we were able to build an extraction
program, we would have been well on our way to processing whole
words and not just vowel sound.</P>

<P> Pitch determination is an semi-effective way of implementing
speaker recognition.  Our pitch determination process could be
refined or could run in parallel with other speaker recognition
methods to produce better results.</P>
