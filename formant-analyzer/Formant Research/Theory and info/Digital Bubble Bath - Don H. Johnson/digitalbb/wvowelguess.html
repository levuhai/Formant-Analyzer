<P> This function is identical to the vowelguess.m funciton
except it places emphasis on certain formants over others.
We found that F1 and F2 should definatedly be given more
weight when calculating the euclidean distance in the 3-d
formant space since F3 had a narrower bandwidth across vowels.  
A weighting matrix W=[w1 w2 w3] corresponds to formants 1, 2 and 
3.  The function could be designed to take the W matrix as an 
input so different W matricies could be used for different speakers
(see <A HREF="outline.gif">Process Flowchart</A>). This function 
also allows for input of a weighting matrix like [1 0 1] in the 
case that the second formant was undetected and thus should have 
no bearing on the distance calculation.
