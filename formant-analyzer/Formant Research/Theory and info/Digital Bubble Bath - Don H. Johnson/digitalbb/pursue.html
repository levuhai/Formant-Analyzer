<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Ideas to Pursue</H2>


<P> Our project has lots of room for growth and improvement still.  It has led us to
uncountable more pathways to follow:</P>

<blockquote>	Extraction!  A whole project on its own would be to write a program
that could extract vowels from speech signals for our formant analysis program.  We
still haven't given up on the possibility of applying wavelet analysis to locate
periodic blocks in a speech signal. </blockquote>

<blockquote>   The next step in making this vowel recognition more professional
would be to continuously calculate formants and pitch, with some sort of windowing
process.  This would allow improved vowel recognition and lead us to consonant
recognition: transient activity of formants just before and just after consonants
gives clues about the consonants themselves.  We could use that fabulous 
frequency tracking program (see <B>Their Finest Hour's</B> function trackplot.m) to 
track the formant frequencies. </blockquote>

<blockquote> 	Developed by us, but not implemented, are formant estimation
algorithms for the cases in which two formants are close together and two
distinct peaks are not discernible by our formant finding program.  Not locating one
of three formants completely throws off our vowel recognition. </blockquote>

<blockquote>	More in-depth speaker recognition can be built into the system with
more quantitative analysis of harmonics, rather than simple pitch determination. 
Something along the lines of the approach by 1995 group <b>P-Squared</b>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>	Speed up peaks.m, currently the slowest component of our program. 
P-squared used a mex-file, other better methods surely exist.</blockquote>

<blockquote>	Incorporate the SGI recording function (also developed by none other
than P-Squared) to record sound data directly from matlab.  Currently it is easier
to do the extraction (by hand) from the SGI soundeditor and soundfiler
programs.</blockquote>
