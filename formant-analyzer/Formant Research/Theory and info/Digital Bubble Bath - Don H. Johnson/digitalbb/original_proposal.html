<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Original Proposal (boy were we naive)</H2>

<P>First there were punch cards.  Then keyboards.  Next came the
mouse.  The exponentially growing power of computers may call
for a new, more elegant way of inputing data.  Wouldn't it be
nice to say "Computer, Open Netscape", or dictate a paper into
a text editor instead of typing? </P>

<P>We plan to use wavelets in exploring speech interpretation.
The continious wavelet transform can be used to transform a time
varying signal (speech audio in our case) to a time frequency
domain.  One of the advantages we gain by using the CWT over 
traditional Fourier Transform is that time information is more
readily avaliable.  We hope to use this time information to
process different voices saying strings of words. </P>

<P>Using Matlab extensively, we will build (program) an 
interpreter.  We will transform speech signals of words like 
"cat", "hat", "rat" into time-frequency representations and see 
how well we can differentiate the words.  We will also explore 
our interpreters ability to differentiate between speakers.  
Finally we hope to develop a process that will be able to tell 
when a few words are spoken, what those words are, what order 
were they spoken in, and who spoke them.</P>

</P>Probelms we hope to tackle:<BR><BR>
1.  Recognizing words<BR>
2.  Recognizing a string of words<BR>
3.  Identifying a voice<BR>
