<P>This function will take an .au sound file of a vowel sound, 
read it into a matlab sound vector and process it using formant 
analysis to determine the vowel spoken.  This file does little 
analysis itself; rather it calls the other necessary m-files in 
the order needed to process the sound.  Therefore, to run this 
program you also need the called functions: normalize.m, 
formants.m, and weightedvowelguess.m</P>

<P>* Note: the ".bin" extension on the m-file does NOT indicate a
binary file type.<BR>  It only tricks your browser into downloading
the file instead of viewing it.</P>
