<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>New Proposal</H2>  

<P>First there were punch cards.  Then keyboards.  Next came the
mouse.  The exponentially growing power of computers may call
for a new, more elegant way of inputing data.  Wouldn't it be
nice to say "Computer, Open Netscape", or dictate a paper into
a text editor instead of typing?</P>

<P>We plan on using Formant Analysis and Pitch Determination in 
exploring speech interpretation.  The Formant Analysis will use
common properties of vowel sound to determine the vowel being
spoken.  Pitch Determination techniques will be used to find the 
pitch of the speakers impulse train and can lead to 
identification.  We also hope to fuse the two methods to produce
more accurate readings in both categories (i.e. determining what
was said can be better determined if we have prior knowledge of
who the speaker was).</P>

<P>Using Matlab extensively, we will build (program) an 
interpreter.  We will analyze vowel sounds extracted from speech 
signals of words like "bob", "hood" and "hawed" by isolating the
formant frequencies of the sounds.  We will also explore 
our system's ability to differentiate between speakers by
extracting the impulse train from resonant vowel sounds and
determine pitch.  Finally we hope to develop a process that will 
be able to extract vowels from words, determine what those words 
were, and who the speaker was.</P>
