<H4 ALIGN=Left>Formant Estimation Programs</H4>

<P>These are two estimation routines to determine formants in
the case when the poles of the AR model are so close together
that two distinct peaks of the frequency response merge into one 
peak.  Program 1 simply
projects a line from the origin through each pole to the unit
circle.  Program 2, the Ghael-Sandgathe method, is an
improvement on the McCandless method, in which the outermost pole
 is extended to just inside the unit 
circle, thereby accentuating the location of the formant.  The
Ghael-Sandgathe method extends all poles out until the two
closest poles actually straddle the unit circle, guaranteeing
maximum possible distinction between the corresponding peaks
of the transfer function.  </P>
