This employer chose the option to require all bidders to fully read (and take the time to understand) this project before responding. I guarantee I have done this. I understand that if I post bidding spam, my site privileges will be removed and my account closed. Here is my brief summary of this project to prove that I read this project's description:

First phase of an iOS speech processing application that plots FFT of speech signal on top and another plot at the bottom.

Top Worker!
 

A bid in the amount of $800.00 USD was posted by EE Guidance (the worker).  

Hi,

I have strong background in DSP and feel quite comfortable with the requirements of your project. 

Indeed your description of requirements is quite thorough but here are a few observations.

1. Without knowing the acoustic response and calibration of iphone microphone, it is not possible to determine if the incoming sound level is above 0dB or not. We need to find the energy in 0.1 sec blocks and decide a threshold based on experimentation.

2. When you say FFT with autocorrelation, you may be implying FFT of autocorrelation function of the sampled speech. This is standard way to find spectrum of random signals. Please have a look at http://cnyack.homestead.com/files/afourtr/ftautps.htm

3. If we take autocorrelation and FFT of entire speech signal, the performance will degrade if speech signal is long. You should consider breaking the speech in 0.1 sec overlapping packets, finding FFT for all packets, and then taking average. This will speed up the algorithm. We can include this approach in next version.

4. If you are going to provide FFT algorithm and vowel plot algorithm in next phase, what will be plotted in the top graph during this phase? It is clear that bottom dummy graph will have two dots connected by a line but it is not clear what will go in top graph.

Please note that I have completed more than 10 iOS projects but none of them involved microphone input. I have been contemplating working on something related to speech processing for some time, something simple like a guitar tuner, but have not been able to allocate time for this activity. But rest assured that I will take care of this as I have already completed two projects based on AVFoundation framework. Those projects only processed video signal but I am quite comfortable with processing of audio signal using AVFoundation framework.

Looking forward to hear from you,

Akmal.

Akmai,

You are the leading bidder on this project, and it looks like you can handle both parts. For your notes about calibrating the microphone and options for doing signal analysis in windows, I would like you to handle these details and experiment to create the best solution. All the details I gave above are negotiable and we can tweak them.

The algorithm is implemented in Matlab here (although other options are available online that we could use):
http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/courses/spsci/matlab/lect10.html

The final plot is simply a dot overlayed on a photo like this:
http://www.ncvs.org/ncvs/tutorials/voiceprod/tutorial/filter.html

The final product would look like this:
http://phor.net/TMP/concept2.png

The audio we are analyzing is spoken vowel sounds, an example is here:
http://phor.net/TMP/sample.wav

==============

Would you be interested to proceed as follows?

I create a private bid for you and you can do the following scoping work:
* Decide what additional information I need to get for you
* Briefly describe the process you would use, which signal processing functions in the IOS API
* Describe how you will debug the app for offline analysis, and how I will be able to verify the relults are accurate
* Provide a price for you to complete the product from start to finish.

You could do this initial effort for $100 with no programming.

I would consider your price then you can develop the whole app, without delivering separate phases.

Please let me know if this is acceptable.

Thank you,
Will

Hi Will,

First of all, I wish you a wonderful start of 2012.

Thank you for your consideration and inclination to hire me for this project. I feel quite comfortable with general requirements of your project because of my academic training in signal processing, which includes an M.Sc. from University of Wisconsin-Madison and a Ph.D. from Georgia Institute of Technology.

Your offer to pay me $100 for scoping and project planning is very much appreciated. However, I feel obligated to raise a few points before we go there so that you only spend $100 if you are certain to hire me for this project. Please consider following points.

1. The mock-up of iphone screen shows upper graph to be an FFT of speech signal and the lower to be a dot over an image, derived from FFT. The latest information shows that we will be working with Cepstrum and will be finding the two formant frequencies. This is significantly more complex than initially described. Due to complexity of the project, I would like to revise my initial bid. I can do that during scoping and proposal writing stage.

2. You had said in original description that you would provide the FFT algorithm to be used. You have given a URL of a tutorial page with MATLAB code. Is this all that you are going to provide? Am I supposed to translate FFT and Cepstrum algorithms from MATLAB to objective-C? As you know that FFT requires processing of complexed-valued entities. Can you provide an objective-C library with FFT and Cepstrum routines? If I find such a library, in pre-compiled format, can I use that? Or do you want me to write original objective-C code to find complex-valued FFT?

3. My main area of expertise is DSP for communication and image processing. Even though I am comfortable with speech processing but have not done any substantial work in this area. For example, at this moment, I am not clear if there will be a training session for each user of our future application so that we know how to scale formant frequencies to draw the dot on the standard vowel diagram. Obviously, the formant frequencies for males and females will be different.

4. There are two major components of this project:

         A. Capturing of speech signal using iOS device.
         B. Processing of captured speech signal.

The first part includes real-time computation of energy in 0.1 sec intervals to turn on/off a 'light' to indicate that sound is being recorded. It also includes storage of recorded speech in a local data structure.

The second part refers to processing of recorded speech to mark a dot corresponding to the uttered vowel.

My question is: Are you willing to break the project into two phases? First phase will be real-time energy detection of 0.1 sec long speech signals to turn on/off the recording light, storage of speech signal in a buffer as long as recording light is on, discarding of 10-15% header and tail of the recorded segment, and displaying of the speech waveform. The second phase will build on top of the first one. It will perform speech analysis and will replace plotting of speech waveform with dot on standard vowel diagram.

5. On the final diagram, you have listed 5 format frequencies but we only need two to mark the dot. Even though I have not done any substantial work in speech processing but my guess is that it will not be possible to reliably measure 5 formant frequencies for all speech utterances. Do we really need to find 5 format frequencies?

6. I will give you final quote of my work during the scoping phase but at this moment my rough estimate is that the cost will be $350-$400 for the first phase and $1000-$2000 for the second phase, depending upon availability (or lack) of FFT and Cepstrum libraries.

I am willing to work with you on this project. My request would be to help and guide me in the areas that need explanation and be flexible in terms of deadlines.

If you are generally comfortable with my rough plan, please go ahead and open a private bid of $100 for detailed scoping and planning of the project. In that phase, I will expand above-listed points, will do some literature survey to see which FFT libraries are available, etc. etc.

With best wishes,

Akmal.

Hello Akmal, 

Happy new year! 

The deadlines are flexible, especially for phase 2. The libraries you use are flexible, although you'll need to explain to me any licensining issues around the libraries and if that will prevent me from releasing this product. I do not have any technical assistance to give regarding objective-C libraries to implement the algorithm.

5 formants are not necessary, it would be nice to have 3. There will be no user training. Differences between male/female/child voices will be handled by changing the background picture in the graph.

I do want to choose you for this project. Could you please submit another bid for this project for $100 and say that you will perform the scoping phase as discussed. This will be the simplest way for us to begin this project.

Thank you,
Will

A bid in the amount of $118.00 USD was posted by EE Guidance (the worker).
The bid was (later) accepted by fulldecent (the employer).
 

Hi Will,

I have placed my bid of $100 to take up the first phase of the project. This bid reflects our recent communication about this project, which states that.

1. The project is divided into total of three phases. First phase is scoping and planning, second phase is real-time capturing of speech from microphone of an iOS device, and third phase is processing the captured speech to find the vowel that was uttered.

2. During the first phase (the current phase), I will prepare a detailed plan for next two phases. I will go through the links that you have provided, the MATLAB code that you have shared, and will perform preliminary analysis of a few vowel sounds using MATLAB. (Please send 5-10 additional vowel sounds).

3. I will also search for available libraries to perform speech analysis using objective-C so that we can quickly complete the third stage. I will give a clear indication of applicability and licensing issues of the available libraries.

4. At this moment, my rough estimates are that the fee for second phase will be in $350-$400 range and fee for third phase will be in $1000-$2000 range. The first phase will allow me to give you more accurate cost estimates of subsequent stages.

5. The first phase can be considered a capability demonstration. You will have no obligation to hire me for subsequent stages if you are not comfortable with my capabilities or approach.

Thank you.

Akmal.

Dear Will,

I am thankful to you for giving me this opportunity to work on a different kind of project. It has some research element to it. Even though speech processing is 40+ years old but still we need to do some literature survey, availability of libraries, and other things not usually found in development-only projects.

If you have some time, please search me on LinkedIn with name M. Akmal Butt as CEO of Picsonics, located in Islamabad, Pakistan. My other email account is HYPERLINK "mailto:m.akmal.butt@gmail.com"m.akmal.butt@gmail.com and skype ID is m.akmal.butt. Lastly, you can search me on HYPERLINK "http://scholar.google.com"scholar.google.com as well. There, you will see that I have a couple of well-cited research paper in my name.

I will prepare my report in next 3-4 days. It will be a demonstration of my capabilities and a well-defined execution plan for next two phases.

Thank you.

Akmal.

Alert: Warning of not using site to communicate (Sent privately and NOT viewable by the other party)

William Entriken,

*******************************************************************
Note: Please ignore this message if you are doing your communication onsite (and either temporarily paused work or were waiting on a response from the other party). You can disable this email from being sent to you in the future on this project via the disable link near the bottom of the message.
*******************************************************************

This an automated email to warn you that we haven't seen any recent onsite communication from you in the last 4 days regarding project "iPhone app for speech analysis" located at 
http://www.vWorker.com/RentACoder/misc/BidRequests/ShowBidRequest.asp?lngBidRequestId=1802362

If you are working with the other party and simply communicating offsite, then you are unnecessarily putting yourself into a dangerous position. While all onsite changes and additions are a part of the legally binding contract, nothing communicated offsite is legally binding. This is due to the fact that offsite communication can be easily falsified (even by a novice) and is indistinguishable from a legitimate offsite communication. 

If a dispute occurs and this project goes into arbitration, you will have no legally binding proof to backup your claims and may be put yourself at an unnecessary disadvantge. If you are an employer, this could mean that features the worker agreed to do for you offsite, could be neglected, and if the project goes to arbitration, you would still be forced to pay the worker full price. If you are a worker, this could mean that a reduction in the requirements agreed to by the employer offsite could be disputed by the employer in arbitration, and because the reduction wasn't documented on site, you would be found at fault for not delivering to your contract. These are just two of many "bad" things that can happen when you don't document requirements and deadline changes onsite.

To correct this situation:

1) Immediately document any changes to the original contract (requirements, deadlines, etc.) onsite and ask the other party to agree to the posting. This not only protects both of you but is also a good communications enhancer because it lets both of you reaffirm what was agreed upon.

2) From now on, communicate exclusively on the site. OR...if you feel you MUST use an offsite communication channel then just remember to always follow it up by doing just as you did in #1. After you complete your offsite conversation, immediately document all the changes that you've both agreed to onsite, and then get the other party to post back a response saying that they agree to it. Again this not only protects both of you but is also a good communications enhancer because it lets both of you reaffirm what was agreed upon.

Hello Akmal,

This is a great introduction and start for the algorithm. I have run your supplied code and see that tweaking the constants can greatly affect the performance, especially energy level (which can help filter out consonants) and segment length/erosion factor (for preprocessing). I don't know what is going to produce the right results, but I see that you have a powerful tool here.

Let's proceed.

Please mark your Phase 1 as complete so I can accept. Please let me know if you are available for Phase 2 now, and I can open that. There is a minor edit for Phase 2. Please use the "Tab Bar" to separate the main application and the help screen. An image is here http://phor.net/TMP/concept3.png Again, just load a basic HTML file (embedded in the project) into that help section, and I will update it later.

FYI, some other tools that may be useful are:

And the latest version of the LPC code you are citing is at:

Hi Will,

Thank you for your words of appreciation. I have used MATLAB for interactive (but offline) processing of a few previously-recorded vowels to demonstrate that I can work on problem like this.

When we will be working in objective-C, we will be doing real-time processing of speech. The approach will be less interactive and we must use a different setup for testing of my code. As you may know, we cannot run (and test) all types of objective-C code in iPhone simulator. Your project involves speech processing and it cannot be run in simulator. We need to run the code on an actual iOS device. Please tell me what sort of development/test setup you have at your end. Are you a paid member of Apple Dev Network? Can you compile and put my code on an iOS device using provisioning profile?

My approach to find and remove (not process) silent regions was simple. I do plan to investigate a couple of other approaches to decide with part of the sound is a vowel and which part is a consonant. That will happen in stage 3.

I am requesting a closure of first phase. Please release the escrowed fund and say a few positive words about my work in the feedback. I will be happy to start the next phase from Tuesday (10th of January). I believe there is an option of one-to-one bidding with lower than 15% vworker.com fee. Please try to use that as it will lower your cost.

I will have no problem putting a help screen into the app. Have you downloaded and tested 'Vietnam Wall & War Explorer'? There is an html file that is shown when user presses 'Info' button. Your help screen can be handled like that. 

I have already told you about my academic and professional background. Please do tell me a little bit about your past and current professional activities.

I am looking forward to start the next phase.

Regards.

Akmal.

Hello Akmal,

The Phase 1 is completed and I have opened Phase 2 at $400 as requested. 

I will be joining the paid iOS Developer Program and own a MacBook Air, iPhone 2, and iPhone 4. I can provide any testing, profiling, or debugging you require as long as you send specific instruction on what to do.

My background has been in computer engineering, where I have worked for the U.S. navy and Google and I did research in data mining social networks. After working at Google, I continued with MS Finance and MBA and now work in Financial Analysis at an engineering firm in Philadelphia. 

This project is for my girlfriend who was born in China and could use help improving her vowel pronounciation. I don't expect it to be profitable, but do want to make this into a product I can sell in the App Store, hopefully to help others.

Regards,
Will
